      <h2>Web Designer / Developer</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Larayb Raja. I am an aspiring digital design student studying at Roehampton University
        for my second year. My website, Student Success Hub, is the outcome of a project that we were assigned in class.
        I created this website based around motivating and helping both current and potential university students
        to balance their studies and personal lives more effectively.</p>

      <p> I have shared many different tools on this site from recipes, to planners, to encouraging stories from 
          former students all in the hope of it resulting in the user becoming more happy with their student life.</p>
